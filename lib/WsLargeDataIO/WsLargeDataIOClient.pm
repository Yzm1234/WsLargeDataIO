=item Description

An object and associated data required for saving.

    Required parameters:
    type - the workspace type string for the object. Omit the version
        information to use the latest version.
    data_json_file - the path to a JSON file containing the object data.
    
    Optional parameters:
    One of an object name or id. If no name or id is provided the name
        will be set to 'auto' with the object id appended as a string,
        possibly with -\d+ appended if that object id already exists as a
        name.
    name - the name of the object.
    objid - the id of the object to save over.
    meta - arbitrary user-supplied metadata for the object,
        not to exceed 16kb; if the object type specifies automatic
        metadata extraction with the 'meta ws' annotation, and your
        metadata name conflicts, then your metadata will be silently
        overwritten.
    hidden - true if this object should not be listed when listing
        workspace objects.

=head2 ObjectSpecification

=over 4



=item Description

An Object Specification (OS). Inherits from ObjectIdentity.
Specifies which object, and which parts of that object, to retrieve
from the Workspace Service.

The fields wsid, workspace, objid, name, ver, and ref are identical to
the ObjectIdentity fields.

REFERENCE FOLLOWING:

Reference following guarantees that a user that has access to an
object can always see a) objects that are referenced inside the object
and b) objects that are referenced in the object's provenance. This
ensures that the user has visibility into the entire provenance of the
object and the object's object dependencies (e.g. references).

The user must have at least read access to the object specified in this
SO, but need not have access to any further objects in the reference
chain, and those objects may be deleted.

Optional reference following fields:
list<string> obj_ref_path - a path to the desired object from the object
    specified in this OS. In other words, the object specified in this
    OS is assumed to be accessible to the user, and the objects in
    the object path represent a chain of references to the desired
    object at the end of the object path. If the references are all
    valid, the desired object will be returned.

OBJECT SUBSETS:

When selecting a subset of an array in an object, the returned
array is compressed to the size of the subset, but the ordering of
the array is maintained. For example, if the array stored at the
'feature' key of a Genome object has 4000 entries, and the object paths
provided are:
    /feature/7
    /feature/3015
    /feature/700
The returned feature array will be of length three and the entries will
consist, in order, of the 7th, 700th, and 3015th entries of the
original array.

Optional object subset fields:
list<string> included - the portions of the object to include
        in the object subset.
boolean strict_maps - if true, throw an exception if the subset
    specification traverses a non-existant map key (default false)
boolean strict_arrays - if true, throw an exception if the subset
    specification exceeds the size of an array (default true)

=head2 GetObjectsParams

=over 4



=item Description

Input parameters for the "get_objects" function.

    Required parameters:
    object_refs - a list of object references in the form X/Y/Z, where X is
        the workspace name or id, Y is the object name or id, and Z is the
        (optional) object version. In general, always use ids rather than
        names if possible to avoid race conditions.
    
    Optional parameters:
    ignore_errors - ignore any errors that occur when fetching an object
        and instead insert a null into the returned list.
